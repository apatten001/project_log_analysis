to connect to the database.

 Questions that were to be answered
-----
1. What are the most popular 3 articles of all time? 
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

Requirements

* Python==3.6.3
* PostgreSQL==9.5.14
* psycopg2

* 2 . `cd to the directory where logs_analysis.py stays`
* 3 . run `python logs_analysis.py` in the command line
